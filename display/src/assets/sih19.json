Pest & diseases are complex, crop/region specific, seasonal, epidemic/endemic, which require integrated approaches to manage the loss. Due to the level of complexity, diagnosis for preventive measures are challenging, particularly our inability to (fore)see the pest/disease occurrence and their life cycle, while the level of difficulty raises with the size of land holdings. Due to the poor visibility of pest and disease occurrences, our ability to integrate and use the data for preventive/prescriptive measures has been the challenge leading to continuous productivity loss.\n\nPROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Crop loss is generally diagnosed by the symptoms developed by pest and diseases, while manual diagnosis has a very limited scope in identifying the damaged plant parts, while recognizing the pattern of pest/disease distribution almost close to impossible in large area. Drone based scanning the large area using both visible and near-infrared light, could help track changes in plants at large scale and identify the distribution pattern very precisely. Further, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven software could process the images; integrate the existing knowledge and develop the solutions in real-time. In addition, such approach could also open the scope of predictive analysis to execute automate alert to the farmers, potentially improve the crop productivity to more than 20%.\n\nPROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a custom drone and integrated software with AI for predictive/prescriptive model against pest and diseases in crop plants.\n\nThe proposed requirements are as follows,\nA: HARDWARE\n1. Drone integrated with IR lenses\n2. Communication device for data transmission to cloud\n\nB. SOFTWARE\n1. “Intelligent” Software that process the digital images; extract the binaries; categorize them to diagonise the biotic stress; integrate with existing knowledge; execute the predictive / prescriptive analysis and generate alerts for communication.\n2. Cloud environment with management dashboard\n\nPROJECT DELIVERABLES:\n1. An aerial survey and data collection system, fully functional with visible and IR lenses. \n2. Managed communication of the images/data to the cloud.\n3. AI driven Software – fully functional for predictive and prescriptive analytics\n4. Alert system for users (including farmers) in various formats including RSS feeds (for news channels) and mobile applications.\n\n-----------------------------","youtubeLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjY58OAXUTs","title":"Drone Doctors","organisation":"ITC Limited","category":"Software","bucket":"Robotics & Drones","complexity":"Complex"},{"description":"To develop a steam trap failure detection system which can detect steam trap failures remotely, accurately and in real-time.

The Float should be able to withstand 100 cycles of external high pressure pulse of 100Bar.            Additional details – In many process plants steam is used as a source of energy. Efficient distribution of steam is critical for maintaining process parameters and ensuring that energy wastage is minimal. An important equipment, part of the distribution network, is the steam trap. A Steam trap is an automatic drain valve which distinguishes between steam and condensate. A well-functioning steam trap will hold back steam in the distribution line while discharging condensate under varying pressures or loads. When the steam trap fails, it can lead to water logging (condensate) in distribution pipes, thus reducing the efficiency of steam energy, disturb process parameters, or even lead to wastage of steam through discharge in open atmosphere. Steam traps are mechanical equipment which employs different principles such as buoyancy, pressure, temperature etc. for their operation.\nA ball float type trap is based on the buoyancy principle where rise in condensate level lifts the ball float, opening the orifice and allowing the condensate to be flushed out of steam carrying pipes. In certain processes, typically on -off heating processes, opening of the valve causes sudden discharge of condensate at very high velocity to the trap. The high velocity water discharge impinges on the float causing it to implode. The ON-OFF cycles expose float to thermal cycle. An efficient and robust design of float is desired to overcome this problem.\nCurrently, Float of 32 gms ( ±4gms), Diameter 57mm , working Pressure 20Bar and Temperature 220°C is used in typical Float Traps.

The product quality in a process is affected by both, process and environmental parameters. In case of a hygroscopic organic product, moisture plays a vital role in determining the end product quality. In the case of this problem it is crucial to maintain the end product moisture level within a narrow band for superior product quality. To achieve the same, online control of various process parameters is required in manufacturing.\n\nPROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The manufacturing process of this product has a drying step which is controlled to get the end product moisture within limits. However, post drying, the retention time and conditions in further process steps impact the final product moisture. The incoming material loses moisture in the drying process. The dryer process parameters are controlled through a PID loop with short and long term levers. Post drying, the product is stored in a conditioned environment and is transferred for manufacture as per requirement. Product interacts with the surrounding environment while residing in the storage area and the manufacturing process. Due to these interactions, the product moisture changes from the desired value of 13.5+/-0.3%. Building a time series machine learning model to predict Ex- Dryer moisture set point will help to achieve Ex-Packing moisture within 13.5+/-0.3% with maximum accuracy.\n\nPROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a Time series Neural Network (LSTM/GRU) model to predict Dryer set point in order to achieve Ex-packer moisture within 13.5+/-0.3\n\n\nPROJECT DELIVERABLES:\n1.

BACKGROUND: To deliver highly relished and supersafe prawns to the consumer, rapid freezing after processing and storage at low temperatures is essential for prawn and prawn products in order to eliminate oxidation, denaturation of proteins, sublimation and recrystallization of ice crystals. Temperature increase of frozen product will result in off-flavors, rancidity, dehydration, weight loss, and loss of juiciness, drip loss, toughening, microbial spoilage and autolysis of the product. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that frozen conditions are maintained during transportation, storage, and in retail stores. This needs to be verifiably demonstrated to the consumer during the time of purchase.  This is feasible only by a bio-sensor which will demonstrate the actual state of the product during its shelf-life.\n\n2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Prawns may be frozen–thawed many times before being consumed. The Frozen prawns may get thawed (core temperature ~ 0 deg C) and refrozen during transportation and repackaging. An increase in the freeze–thaw cycles, greater than -180C, results in augmenting Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value and cutting force while lowering the salt soluble protein (SSP) value. This leads significant deterioration in product quality. The prawns can be freeze–thawed only up to 2 cycles. In addition, the product will be spoiled if there is a slow re-freezing time which steeply increases the bacterial count in the prawns. Therefore, it is important demonstrate the temperature fluctuations and actual state of the monitored packed frozen meat to the consumer illustrating the product quality and safety.\n\n\n3. PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a low-cost Time Temperature visual biosensors which will change it basic characteristics, such as color, and ensure ongoing communication with shoppers.  This should result in maximizing freshness, minimize waste, and augment the brand value of frozen shrimp products. \n\n4. PROJECT DELIVERABLES\n\n(a) To develop a time series data logger which will be both visual and machine readable. It should be user friendly, can be calibrated to suit products with varying shelf-life, and compatible with existing other machine-logging technologies\n\n(b) Desired protypes (For Testing): The built prototype should be accurate, precise, and reproducible in temperature monitoring, especially with increasing temperature from – 18 deg. C., to ambient condition. Changes in characteristics, such as color (or) chemical properties, should be faster with increasing temperature and preferably capture the entire shelf-life. Integration of technology using existing raw materials. process, and products, such as paper and films, and printing will be added advantage\n--------------------------------","youtubeLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbFlYb2crso","title":"Intelligent Food packaging","organisation":"ITC Limited","category":"Hardware","bucket":"Miscellaneous","complexity":"Simple"},{"description":"We want to automate through mobile app our valuation reports containing photographs with digital signature eliminating hard copies.

In India, there is no regular system for collecting data on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which can be said to be of adequate coverage or quality. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481705/\n \nWhile disease burden surveys from the likes of ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) do provide directional insights, bottom-up data is certainly more effective in making focused interventions.\n \nFor instance, focused on cardio-vascular and diabetes, identification of prevalence and micro-segments of population at risk is critical to deliver care as these require specialist interventions, not easily available in the rural markets. These conditions also require the patients to be on long term care in terms of continuous parameter evaluation and management of the vital parameters. Better understanding of prevalence through early diagnosis and focused geographical/demographical views help deploy the sparse resources effectively – both by the public and private health institutions.               \nObjective: How can a combination of UIDAI/Aadhaar, “Low fidelity high frequency” medical devices that can capture recurring diagnostic data at a high frequency come together to enable better data collection? How can advanced data analytics (ML/DL/AI) on top of this data platform help improve 10x, the diagnosis and intervention touch points for non-communicable diseases (NCD) focused on Cardio-Vascular and Diabetes, primarily in Rural/Semi-Urban environments?Guidance:\n•             Solution should have measurable key performance indicators (KPI)\n•             KPI should be clearly linked to the goal of improving the early diagnosis of these conditions as well as enable planners give access to the distribution of patient population\n•             Note: Solution proposed should enable identification of patients to ensure the attributability and accuracy of the data but respect the data privacy of the patients\n•             You might want to narrow down the problem into sub parts or address all separately.

Doctors write the brand name of the drug rather than the active ingredient name. (Eg. NISE instead of Nimesulide, or Crocin instead of Paracetamol). Apart from OTC (Over the Counter Drugs) a health care practitioner (Doctor) can only prescribe a medicine. Hence the end consumer is not the decision maker.\nTo increase revenue all the pharmaceutical companies strive to get mind share of the doctor so that for a particular drug their brand is at the top of the evoked set. It is against the law to provide any direct inducement to the doctor to prescribe a certain brand.\nHence, pharmaceutical companies send Medical Representatives (MR) to the doctor frequently to ensure the doctor is reminded of the brand / Brand Recall. Medical representatives also provide information to the doctors on new product launch, new packaging or other information about the brand. They also inform the doctor about the brand availability at the local pharmacy stores. There are multiple theories on why a doctor prescribes a certain brand. One theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because they trust the quality. Another theory is that they have a certain evoked set of brands and divides the prescriptions arbitrarily based on the brand that comes to their mind. Another theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because of personal working relationship or even in some cases out of sympathy due to general longer waiting time of MRs to meet him/her.\nMedical representative gets very small share of the doctor's time. Usually the interaction lasts from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Medical representatives have to spend a lot of time waiting for the doctor's time or travelling from one clinic/hospital to another. Pharma companies have to employ a huge force of Medical Representatives to ensure reach to doctors. However, this is very expensive to scale up.\n \nObjective:\nTo enable 10 X growth in prescriptions with digital technology as an enabler\n \nGuidance:\n•             Solution should have measurable key performance indicators (KPI)\n•             KPI should be clearly linked to the goal of generating prescriptions.\n•             Solution should be scalable\n•             No part of Solution should include any direct inducement to the doctor (Eg. Commission or direct material favours)\n•             You might want to narrow down the problem into sub parts or address all separately. You can address one or more of the following  :\n•             Increasing the effectiveness of the Interaction between doctor and MR\n•             Enabling the same MR team to reach more doctors\n•             Enable reach to doctors without MR through digital means (Doctors not getting covered by MR visits)\n•             At least one example of the experience journey should be provided in the solution where you provide the details of how your solution will change a day in life of the Doctor and a MR etc\n•             The 10 X growth is kept as a framework so that that you don’t provide an incremental solution which cannot be scaled.","youtubeLink":"","title":"Leveraging Digital Solutions to solve for 10X growth in prescriptions","organisation":"Dr Reddy's Labs","category":"Software","bucket":"Healthcare & Biomedical Devices","complexity":"Complex"},{"description":"Coconut refers to coconut without husk that is normally available at Retail shops. Said coconut consists of Outer shell, Coconut meat (with 45-55% moisture) & water inside. Copra manufacturing from Coconut involves breaking of coconut, scooping and subsequent Sun Drying of coconut meat. The entire process takes around 6-7 days. Moisture of final copra (dried coconut meat) is around 5-6%.  Copra Yield is defined as the amount of copra produced from 1 kg of coconut. Yield ranges from 23% to 34% and is key Parameter for defining Nut quality and Prices.

Many countries are taking harsh decision to close down thermal and nuclear. An alternative source, catching the attention of everyone is renewable energy from Solar and wind, which require no fuel and abundantly available according to geographical location.\nHowever, it has its own characteristic and throw upon challenges to integrate into transmission and distribution grid. \nSolar Energy\n1. Solar Energy is available only during daytime and quantum of power varies according to time in bell shape form. This bell shape will change according to season.\n2. Solar Energy is variable in the cloudy weather conditions.\nWind Energy\n1. Though available throughout the year. Wind potential varies location to location (that’s why installed in specific areas mostly in remote locations) and season to season.\n2. Wind is variable, intermittent and unpredictable during 24 hrs. of the day.\nLocation wise wind potential makes the task of transmission and distribution utility/grid operation more difficult in absence of local consumption as well as adequate network.\nWind Energy is at peak during monsoon. This is the season when power demand is low. Grid operation has a challenge of handling the excess renewal energy. Grid operation is planned day ahead by taking supply (generator) and demand (utility) commitment. Grid operator is bound to control supply-demand balance to maintain frequency, but it becomes challenging when wind energy is accounted as part of supply in the day ahead planning due to variable and intermittent nature of wind. Grid operator is compelled to back-down conventional sources of generation to minimum level (inefficient operation) for load balancing.\nWith above background of renewable energy generation, there is need of software solution/modes in the hands of grid operator to predict solar and wind energy generation day ahead as well as during grid operation on hourly basis to guide them for load management.\nBenefits: Right solar and wind energy prediction model will enable grid operator to plan dispatches and manage load balancing and efficient operation of power plant.","youtubeLink":"","title":"Wind and Solar energy prediction","organisation":"SkipperSeil","category":"Software","bucket":"Software - Mobile App development","complexity":"Complex"},{"description":"Outgoing Mails & Incoming mails to a particular Mail Id.

Detecting heart rate using only camera has an added advantage because in such case the users do not require any skills or compliance, but has to just capture image/video. During exercise, it is often desired that the user can measure their heart rate without any extra accessory. Wearing a wearable during exercise can be uncomfortable to certain users. Catering to the phenomenon of people using camera as the most popular smartphone feature we can address this problem. \nThis work will predominantly focus on estimating Heart Rate in real-time from facial images captured using smartphone camera.  With every Heart Beat blood flows to our face. Whenever our heart circulates blood, the amount of light reflected from the face varies. To the human eye, this variation is invisible. But using image processing techniques we can detect these changes. The underlying principle is to analyse the spatio-temporal variations in the time-series facial images and amplify these variations. The time series of color values at pixels in region of interest is used to estimate the heart rate. For this work data needs to be collected at various lighting conditions: i) Daytime Outdoor (Cloudy and Sunny) ii) Daytime Indoor iii) Night-time Indoor. Data needs to be acquired for resting and exercising condition.

NPS improvement\n“It is the customer who determines what a business is, what it produces, and whether it will prosper.” The concept of customer centricity is not new, today almost every company vision includes customer centricity as a key driver of its strategy. Companies that adopt this philosophy are 60% more profitable compared to companies that are not focused on the customer.  The world is changing around us, the customer base, technology and the environment. For these reasons, we are more focused than ever at the online web-based after sale services will help us to elevate our business and have better connect with end customer, so that products offered not only have functional value but emotional value too.\nTargeting retailers, distributors and competitive customer conversion will aid in accelerate existing market share.\nOne of the challenge in customer conversion is ease of customer with linked TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. To support end customer understanding the new technologies and make them conversant with the IIOT thru digital way, we need to create a platform where the End Consumer can access the pool of competent and skilled manpower to serve their needs at the time of need with a greater pace.\nThis platform can be accessed not only by SMSE where they will enjoy the services at shared basis at much nominal cost but will also be accessed by heavy Industries for their complex application and consultancies for their Plant maintenance and services. Lack of customer confidence and invisibility of right support are the predominant reasons of lower efficiency productions in Indian Industries. Unplanned downtime can cost a company as much as 20MINR an hour (according to research).\nIndian electrical markets are driven by distributors and retailers. Around 95% of total electrical business is catered by distributors and retailers. They have reach to the remotest of the places, since they do not have the competence of VFD commissioning the do not serve the customers with this product and hence the availability of the product becomes an issue to EU resulting into bigger downtime.\nTo facilitate these distributors and to serve the EU in time of need Schneider Electric will be first in market to ignite opportunity by setting the world of commissioning in motion. A location based web application that makes an on-demand hiring from pool of certified engineers, electricians or freelance consultants with competency status enables you to grow your business in an efficient way, while conserving your own resources. Certified engineers will adjust the drive parameters to meet the precise demands of the application. This app would leverage our customers to confide in Schneider Electric.\n\nApplication is engineer-sharing for fast, reliable commissioning in minutes – day or night. There’s no need to wait, you have to just tap request engineer, and it’s easy to pay with credit card or cash. App based services will be cost effective as it provides nearest solution available in that area, distance plays an important factor in deciding cost for services. Today customer is dependent on channel and on availability of its engineers but with this app, customer will be independent to choose an engineer anytime, wherever he wants. It will be transparent service helping customers to provide a seamless digital service experience. Every service kind will be in the database of Schneider and thus reduce the total cost of ownership of the EU. Access to cloud based data can further be used by customer care to trigger warnings to customer for monthly or annual maintenance and end of product life information, product and systems health reports.\n\nIn a nutshell this app will not only provide the above mentioned benefits but also reduce total cost of ownership and provides overall equipment efficiency.","youtubeLink":"","title":"The Schneider Industry Uber-like service app","organisation":"Schneider Electric","category":"Software","bucket":"Software - Mobile App development","complexity":"Complicated"},{"description":"The sales representative has to be agile to modify the sales pitch based on the interest level of the customer.

Besides, peri-urban agriculture is using the urban waste water as a major source of irrigation, thus posing health hazards to the both farmers as well as consumers. \nDecentralized treatment of urban waste water has been identified as the only solution in light of ever increasing urban settlements and shrinking availability of unused land and good quality of water resources. A decentralized treatment plan can work with precision, when input and output of the plant is monitored unbiasedly on a real-time basis. Installation of geo-tagged sensors viz.

This has aggravated the issue of declining water table (0.4 m per year), while encouraging wastage of water in many states. The mounting pressure on water resources justifies that sustainable use of water resources is fundamental priority in Indian agriculture. Since, water is the most limiting factor in agriculture, technology interventions for sustainable use of water resources at grass root level is the need of the hour.
